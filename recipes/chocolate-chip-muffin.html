    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These chocolate chip muffins are simply delicious. You won't believe how easy and quick they are to make!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Milk: </b> This moist chocolate chip muffin recipe starts with milk.</li>
        <li><b>Oil: </b> Instead of butter, this recipe calls for a neutral oil (such as vegetable oil).</li>
        <li><b>Egg: </b> An egg lends moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the batter together.</li>
        <li><b>Flour: </b> All-purpose flour gives the batter structure.</li>
        <li><b>Sugar: </b> White sugar sweetens things up a bit.</li>
        <li><b>Baking Powder: </b> Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise.</li>
        <li><b>Chocolate Chips: </b> Of course, you'll need chocolate chips!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.</li>
        <li>Combine milk, oil, and egg in a small bowl until well blended. Combine flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl, making a well in the center. Pour milk mixture into well and stir until batter is just combined; fold in chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full. Mix 3 tablespoons white sugar and brown sugar together in a small bowl; sprinkle on tops of muffins.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the tin briefly, then transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm or cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
