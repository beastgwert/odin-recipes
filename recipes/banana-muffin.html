        <li><b>Bananas: </b> Of course, you'll need mashed bananas!</li>
        <li><b>Sugar: </b> White sugar sweetens things up a bit.</li>
        <li><b>Egg: </b> An egg binds the muffin batter together and lends moisture.</li>

    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners. Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix bananas, sugar, egg, and melted butter in a separate large bowl until well combined; fold in flour mixture until smooth. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.</li>
